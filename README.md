# Talal's Go Playground
A repo with my golang experiments

## Alpha

Shows how you can structure your repo with subpackages to obtain orthognality between schema and datastore adapter. Use package naming and import delcarations to make it easy to plug and play.

## Jeeway

Same concept as Alpha but uses interface around db functions to achieve the same result.
